### Microphone
Technically, the Sennheiser TeamConnect Ceiling 2 is a microphone array, but since the individual microphones inside it are inaccessible, we treat the whole array as one microphone, and we refer to it as one. Unless specified otherwise, the word **microphone** will refer to the entire Ceiling 2.

### Speaker plane
An imaginary 2D plane in the room, on which speakers' mouths are located (roughly, depending on height of the speaker).
