Hasn't looked at project plan yet. Will look Wednesday morning and give feedback
before we have to hand it in.

Advice:
* Pinpoint to client what assumptions we made and ask them about it.
* Point out in emails to client what you want feedback on
* What if client rejects?
	* There is no need to reverse engineer anything. The project is about
	  software.
	* We should not worry too much about the use of our project to the
	  client. It's our project. They probably want to attract talent.
* Go make a document writing what to discuss with the client.

We can not get a change of Project Plan deadline, but we can change requirements
later.
No need to work overtime to add new requirements to the project plan. We can
tell TA next week if anything changes.
We need to add a planning to the Project Plan with our own deadlines (not just
client deadlines).

Coach: meet again in week 5.
Leave values unexplained in CoC
