ToC should be before Summary

Question
What does "Heading is the same as the number one" mean - p21
Answer
It was due to 4.4.1. Take a look at the font we use for YOLO. Compare it to the title font. They might be the same
Then check the font for "waiting for small movement". Use smaller font when only using headings.

Remove MoSCoW possibly.
