Make a demo for the midterm (mandatory) and for next week or week after.
* We will try to have presets for the midterm demo.

We will hear about the date of the midterm meeting.

The UI is really important, otherwise our project is too small. The UI "is a good first step".
We have to think about extensions, because TA thinks the project is not big enough. We will hear more about whether our project is big
enough in later meetings.
We shouldn't worry too much about the size of our project, but the scope of the project is a bit vague for now.

What is the length of the final report?
About 12000 words, depending on the size of the appendices and figures. We could add a manual as appendix.

From week 3 to 8, the goal is to code 80% of the time and work on the report 20% of the time.
There is no need to make the TW assignments perfect. TA will give feedback to TA meeting about excess of time spent on the report.

It is up to us whether to include system/integration tests in the pipeline.
We could use mypy for type checking in Python. It also checks function calls.

##### Rubrics
Research has to be in the final report.
The midterm is not about a grade, but about a green/red light.
If we want to do well in the course, check the final rubrics.

We get feedback on the final project plan by the end of the week plus feedback on the requirements. We have to incorporate the feedback in
the final report, no need project plan.

We should ask for formal feedback from the coach via email.

We are not on track for a 9.5. TA will tell us more on how to improve after reading the project plan.
We shouldn't be limited by the client.
