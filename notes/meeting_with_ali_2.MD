We have shown the demo so far, and superviser was pleased.

We can use the microphone before it has been set up, but we have to connect it with a LAN cable.

Current envision of the solution is feasible and client agrees with it. However, he also suggested that we use tracking to reduce the possible
locations of the speaker on the direction vector that we get from the microphone.

He will provide us with an implementation of a tracking algorithm.
