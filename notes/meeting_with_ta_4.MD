Everyone was present during the meeting. First topic of our agenda was our progress. We showed our TA
the results of the previous week's sprint(adding presets, visualization, calibration and camera API).
Furthermore, we talked about how we can improve on our final report. TA suggested that we could add any source for a reference
(lecture slides included). We should speak with client regarding whether or not we should add camera footage on our web ui - not required
by TA. Ta was pleased with what we have so far. 

# Next week
No TA meeting in week 5
Agreed for 23th as the date for the midterm next week.
Not yet sure about the endterm.
