Week 4 Sprint Progress:
We talked about what we have done in the current week. Furthermore, we showed the presets demo and Ali was pleased. 

Question round:

Q1: How should we go about streaming camera footage to WebUI?
A2: Use OpenCV or GStream for camera footage. 

Q2: Should we test it on a raspberry?
A2: Not necessary, if it works on a laptop it should be working on any device.

Next week:
Next Thursday, we will test our code on a raspberry-pi. We should make an archive with the code for that purpose.
We will get code for tracking as soon as today. WARNING. MAKE SURE NOT TO SHARE TRACKING CODE.
