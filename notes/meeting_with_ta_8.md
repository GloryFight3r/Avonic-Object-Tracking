# Meeting with Sven
* Today is the last day of the sprint
* Izzy - object tracking + report
  - No wired connection with camera so far
  - assistant to audio tracking
* Petr - settings page + timeout + fixes
* Borislav - object tracking (separate from Izzy) + demo
* Ivan - Mutation testing + settings help + code quality
* Yehor - Refactoring model system + mutation testing + code quality + persistence files (checking json file)
* Wiki is less formal + more focused on end result, report is formal + focused on the process
* How to structure the report
  - problem analysis is strictly only about the problem, no room for solution there!!
  - something about initial analysis, some things that caused to change
  - workflow&teamwork sounds like description of process amongst ourselves, communication w/ sven and client
  - solution, these are our choices, this is why we implemented them -> section for choices/decisions
  - send our progress to sven over the week, he will give feedback, ask for CONCRETE questions about sections! to qun as well
* Demo for endterm presentation
  - no more than five minutes, can be video!
  - reserved rooms by course on mytimetable - how to get them?
* Implementing feedback better :D
* Take a look at final rubric, ask questions if any!!
