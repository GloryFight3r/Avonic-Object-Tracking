When to use calibration and when object tracking
- object detection is needed when the person is not moving (sitting) - nicely frame the person
How is it going
- right now, we pass, but make documentation, diagrams, decisions w/ object detection, other choices w/ calculation
- better than adding more features
- we didn't improve the calibration because of ...
- coach is expecting us to use "state of the art"
- its ugly, it could be better - good mindset
Overwriting cali/presets files
- if its wrong, ignore and dont use it, overwrite later
- use pyaml, good package
