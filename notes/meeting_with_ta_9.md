### Standup:
Izzy: finished object tracking and worked on the report
Ivan: added a new tracking mode without adaptive zooming and worked on documentation in the code
Borislav: worked on three merge requests and solved issues with production mode
Petr: worked on calibration not working in production mode. After that worked a lot on running the software on the Jetson
Yehor: worked on using the GPU for the Jetson and fixing the footage issue. Also worked a lot on the report and a bit on the wiki

### Jetson problem
* Sven thinks the program not working on the Jetson is not a big problem, because it was not our fault.
* We have to make sure we make a nice demo video. Sven suggests to do the demo on our own pc, but we
have to discuss it with Ali. We should explain why it does not work on the Jetson.

### Report feedback
* The client stakeholder can be split up (if we want to). There are more groups of people who interact
with the system. It may be a passive interaction. The presenter may also be a stakeholder in this way.
* The ethics part should stay in the report.
    * We could elaborate on the surveillance part. Also give arguments why it is not a big issue.
* Requirements are good. The evolution is brief, which is good.
* The solution chapter is good. Thorough explanation. Nice alternatives.
    * Funny easter egg
* A screenshot of the web UI could be in the Solution (a bit earlier than it is now).
    * We could also add a screenshot of the old UI to show how it changed.
* An image of the microphone and camera could also be nice.
* We should discuss future improvements earlier in the report (Reflection).
* We could also discuss process improvements in the Reflection.
* We can be more brief in the Challenges (cut them in half) to free up space.
* Requirements, functionality and definition of done are important, so we should keep them as is.
* We should not cut too much in chapter 5.
* We should check the requirements for technical writing to see if we can move Ethics to an appendix.
* Sven likes our Problem Analysis and our Solution chapters.

### General comments
* We can invite anyone for the final presentation.

### Walk Sven through the code
* We explained where the tests are, the important files and the configuration files.

The code will be frozen the weekend after week 10.
