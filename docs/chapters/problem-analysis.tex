\section{Ethical implications}
For our project, we try to direct a camera to a speaker in a room, using video and audio information.
As video and audio information are considered to be personal and can be used with malicious intent, we are cautious and thoughtful with regard to the ethics of the system.
The ethical implications of the system should be carefully reviewed to not allow any unethical abuse of the system.
Below we explain our answer to each question in the Ethics Checklist to give more insight into our system and its potential use cases.
\subsection{Processing of personal data}
Our project revolves around working with a microphone and a camera.
Both of these process personal data in the forms of audio and video and transmit this so that it can be used by people.
Our system does not use any identifiable part of the data because we only utilize the location information from the speaker.
Therefore, our system does not, in and of itself, process any personal data, but the hardware that we use together with the system does.
For instance, the microphone, made in Germany by Sennheiser, processes audio from the room.\\
We can not modify the camera or microphone (or otherwise alter their behavior), so what we can do to mitigate the ethical risks of our project is to ensure we do not use the transmitted personal information.
\subsection{Profiling or systematic monitoring}
Our tools (a camera and a microphone, conceptually) could technically be used in the surveillance of a room of people who have not consented to having video taken of them.
We have access to the video camera stream, but we are not planning to store anything on the device after processing it locally.
Our software alone therefore cannot be used to profile or monitor individuals.
A person who has access to the microphone and the video stream is able to more accurately identify the speaking person and afterward store this information.
Those ethical implications do not fall on us as the developers in this scenario.
\subsection{Processing of previously collected data}
We do not have access and are not allowed to use any of the data stored by our client’s company.
The system could be extended with visual tracking that might require data from previously recorded people, but that data would be coming from publicly available, previously trained models.
Apart from the visual tracking feature, there is no part of our system which requires previously stored data.
\subsection{Exporting to non-EU countries}
As explained above, the microphone and camera that we are using can be used to send personal data to any place in the world.
This data involves video and audio of people.
We can prevent the data obtained from going abroad by limiting the traffic from the network.
\subsection{Importing of personal data}
We do not plan on importing personal data from anywhere.
We do not personally need the data obtained using the microphone and camera, so we will surely not import any data from non-EU countries.
Users of the cameras and microphones can use those devices to create personal data and send it abroad, but they could use any camera to do this, and it does not pose any ethical risks besides the ones explained in the second question.

\section{Possible pitfalls}
At the start, we identified a few possible risks which we needed to decide on how to avert.
As these risks threatened to slow down our progress, we tried to reduce their impact as much as possible.
Below are the issues listed in order of severity.
\subsection{Access to hardware}
The largest risk was access to the hardware (or lack thereof).
Since our project relies on the availability of both the camera and microphone, we would have been unable to work on it without them.
Avonic's representative -- Ali -- notified us that we would only be able to come to the office three days a week, which would have prevented us from working on the project sometimes.\\
We were allowed to bring a camera home to test, but that was not an option with the very expensive and large ceiling microphone.
We mitigated this by using a virtual private network (VPN) connection to the office.
This way we at the very least had a way to access the microphone, although we could not test it very well when nobody from the group was at the office.
