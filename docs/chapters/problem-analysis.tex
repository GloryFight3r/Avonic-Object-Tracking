\section{Ethical implications}
For our project, we try to direct a camera to a speaker in a room, using video and audio information.
As video and audio information are considered to be personal and can be used with malicious intent, we are cautious and thoughtful with regard to the ethics of the system.
The ethical implications of the system should be carefully reviewed to not allow any unethical abuse of the system.
Below we explain our answer to each question in the Ethics Checklist to give more insight into our system and its potential use cases.
\subsection{Processing of personal data}
OOur project revolves around working with a microphone and a camera.
Both of these process personal data in the forms of audio and video and transmit this so that it can be used by people.
Our system does not use any identifiable part of the data because we only utilize the location information from the speaker.
Therefore, our system does not, in and of itself, process any personal data, but the hardware that we use together with the system does.
For instance, the microphone, made in Germany by Sennheiser, processes audio from the room.\\
We can not modify the camera or microphone (or otherwise alter their behavior), so what we can do to mitigate the ethical risks of our project is to ensure we do not use the transmitted personal information.
\subsection{Profiling or systematic monitoring}
Our tools (a camera and a microphone, conceptually) could technically be used in the surveillance of a room of people who have not consented to having video taken of them.
We have access to the video camera stream, but we are not planning to store anything on the device after processing it locally.
Our software alone therefore cannot be used to profile or monitor individuals.
A person who has access to the microphone and the video stream is able to more accurately identify the speaking person and afterward store this information.
Those ethical implications do not fall on us as the developers in this scenario.
\subsection{Processing of previously collected data}
We do not have access and are not allowed to use any of the data stored by our client’s company.
The system could be extended with visual tracking that might require data from previously recorded people, but that data would be coming from publicly available, previously trained models.
Apart from the visual tracking feature, there is no part of our system which requires previously stored data.
\subsection{Exporting to non-EU countries}
As explained above, the microphone and camera that we are using can be used to send personal data to any place in the world.
This data involves video and audio of people.
We can prevent the data obtained from going abroad by limiting the traffic from the network.
\subsection{Importing of personal data}
We do not plan on importing personal data from anywhere.
We do not personally need the data obtained using the microphone and camera, so we will surely not import any data from non-EU countries.
Users of the cameras and microphones can use those devices to create personal data and send it abroad, but they could use any camera to do this, and it does not pose any ethical risks besides the ones explained in the second question.
