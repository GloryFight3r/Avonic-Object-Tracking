Avonic is a company based in Delft with over fifteen years of experience in the field of audio-visual solutions. They specialize in producing PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) cameras for markets like education, enterprise, and politics all around the world. 
As the are not many working solutions that integrate video-capturing device and the microphone array, that can be easily used by the clients, Avonic has decided to investigate the possibility of combining a camera and a microphone to increase the accuracy of tracking speakers. 
Our team found the idea and motivation of the project interesting, and as members of our group with diverse backgrounds, we have decided to collaborate with Avonic.
Together we believe that automating the process of speaker tracking and speaker switching will increase the quality of the recordings and eliminate potential human errors introduced in them. 
This project is done as part of CSE2000 "Software Project" course of the Computer Science and Engineering Bachelor programme at Technical University of Delft.
