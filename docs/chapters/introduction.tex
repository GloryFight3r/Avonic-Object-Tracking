\section{Problem statement}
Recordings of meetings and presentations have become a significant part of our jobs and
lives, but how can they be improved? Static videos can often miss the essential drawings
made by the speaker or be less appealing if the presenter is not in the center of the frame.
There exist solutions that rely on movement\cite{chapel2020moving} or face tracking\cite{huang2018real-time-face-detection}, but they miss out on one big
problem - in interactive scenarios, where speakers do not move much, they cannot exactly
point toward a person correctly, so they rely on heuristics, to know when to capture the whole
frame. Although it is impossible to track a presenter or a
person who is talking in an interactive scenario with a single camera, new products arose
that in combination with a camera can form a strong union that should be capable of better
tracking the presenter.


The objective of this report is to present and explain the details of the development process,
research, and results obtained by our team when developing an application for tracking a
speaker using Sennheiser TeamConnect 2\cite{team-connect-2} and Avonic’s Pan–tilt–zoom camera(PTZ) Camera.
We perform this experiment on behalf of Avonic in a span of ten weeks. 
The main outcome of our project should be whether or not the microphone can be used in combination with the camera to improve the accuracy of tracking speakers. 


The report has the following structure. Chapter 2 will provide a Problem analysis covering
the technical and ethical aspects of the system. Chapter 3 will include the solution
engineering process - our final solution and why picked that one, over other algorithms we
have discovered along the way. The requirements and how they were changed with the
development of the project are described in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 gives an insight into our
team workflow and how we collaborated with our client - Avonic. A retrospective of the
project is found in Chapter 6. Finally, the conclusion and key takeaways are stated in
Chapter 7.
