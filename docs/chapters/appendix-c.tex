        \textbf{Requirement} & \textbf{Worked on by} \\


    \hline \hline
    \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\textbf{Must have}} \\
    \hline
    The user must be able to send requests and receive acknowledgments from the Sennheiser
TeamConnect Ceiling 2 microphone.
        & {} \\
    \hline
    The user must be able to get the direction to the speaker’s location from the microphone API.
        & {} \\
    \hline
    The user must be able to send requests to the Avonic CM-70 camera.
        & {} \\
    \hline
    The user must be able to point the camera in a certain direction.
        & {IG} \\
    \hline
    The user must be able to point the camera to specific pre-set locations,
        choosing the closest one to where the microphone is currently pointing.
        & {} \\
    \hline
    The system must be able to follow the speakers, knowing the camera’s and
        microphone’s defined position, assuming that all speakers are located
        in the same plane
        & {IG} \\
    \hline
    The system must have a web interface for easy use of the camera’s API.
        & {IG} \\

    \hline \hline
    \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\textbf{Should have}} \\
    \hline
    The user should be able to calibrate the system with data such as
        specifying the height of the microphone above the speaker plane.
        & {IG} \\
    \hline
    The system should be able to find the relative position between the camera
        and the microphone provided only the height of the microphone and the
        speaker plane.
        & {IG} \\
    \hline
    The system should be able to translate the calculated coordinates relative
        to the microphone to coordinates the camera can point to.
        & {IG} \\

    \hline \hline
    \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\textbf{Could have}} \\
    \hline
    The system could be able to adapt the camera’s speed depending on how fast
        the speaker is moving.
        & {} \\
    \hline
    The system could have visual tracking to improve the positioning of the camera.
        & {IG} \\

    \hline
    The system could enable the camera to zoom in appropriately depending on the speaker’s
        distance from it.
        & {} \\
    \hline
